Cattlectl is a tool for managing [Rancher 2](https://rancher.io) projects

Use cattlectl to:

* Apply project descriptors to a rancher managed kubernetes cluster
* Use one configuration as code to install to multiple stages
* Automate deployments to rancher managed kubernetes clusters from your CI server.

Install
-------

* Binary download of cattlectl can be found [on the Release page.](https://github.com/bitgrip/cattlectl/releases)
* Unpack the `cattlectl` binary and add it to your PATH and you are good to go!

Usage as docker image
---------------------

* You need to mount your descriptor to the directory `/data` in your container.
* `cattlectl` is the ENTRYPOINT so that you can use the cattlectl commands directly.

```bash
docker run --rm \
-v $(pwd):/data \
bitgrip/cattlectl apply
```
